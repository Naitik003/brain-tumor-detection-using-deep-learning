Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning
This project aims to build a deep learning model for detecting brain tumors from MRI scan images. The goal is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can accurately classify brain images as tumor or non-tumor, and further deploy it as a web application using Flask.
