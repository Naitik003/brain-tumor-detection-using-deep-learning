Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning
This project aims to build a deep learning model for detecting brain tumors from MRI scan images. The goal is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can accurately classify brain images as tumor or non-tumor, and further deploy it as a web application using Flask.

üß† Project Workflow
1. Data Preparation
The dataset of brain MRI scans is sourced from Kaggle.
It includes images labeled as tumor and no tumor.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform analysis to understand data distribution, image characteristics, and class imbalance.
3. Data Augmentation
Address the class imbalance issue using augmentation techniques.
Augmentations include rotation, flipping, and zooming to generate more diverse training data.
4. Data Preprocessing
Utilize OpenCV for preprocessing tasks such as resizing, normalization, and grayscale conversion.
5. Data Splitting
Split the dataset into three parts: training, validation, and testing sets to ensure robust model evaluation.
6. Model Building
Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification.
The architecture includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers to extract features and make predictions.
7. Model Fine-Tuning
Apply techniques like unfreezing layers and adjusting learning rates to improve the model's accuracy.
8. Flask Application
Develop a Flask-based web application to provide a user-friendly interface for uploading MRI scans and getting predictions.
